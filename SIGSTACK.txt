Some TODOs/bugs:

    - Need to get semaphores and mutexes working, as the some non-primary codepaths need this:
        - Enabling the FLAG_preallocate_message_memory commandline flag
        - Profiling
        - Logging
        - Debugging

    - Need to create Thread implementation that uses a top-level run loop,
      looking for runnable Thread instances and resuming them. This can be
      outside of the V8 source.

    - Implement corona purely in terms of v8::internal::Thread instances; this
      way we can switch between a backends (more) easily.
